# advent-of-code-2016
My work toward http://adventofcode.com/ for the 2016 season. First few days were in Python 2.6. Converted over to 3 now.
Using this as an opportunity to learn Python, so please understand the woefully inept programming style.

Especially fun has been to learn (and make plenty of mistakes about) how to use Git, PyCharm, and Github on my own instance without upsetting anyone else. Highly recommended technique.
